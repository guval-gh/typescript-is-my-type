## Introduction

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. This means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code, but TypeScript adds additional features on top of JavaScript.

Key features of TypeScript include:

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript introduces type annotations that allow developers to add type information to their code. This enables better tooling support, earlier error detection, and improved code maintainability.

- **Object-Oriented Features**: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming concepts like classes, interfaces, inheritance, and modules, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications.

- **IDE Support**: Thanks to its type system, TypeScript provides excellent IDE support with features like intelligent code completion, refactoring, and inline documentation.

- **ECMAScript Compatibility**: TypeScript is designed to align with ECMAScript standards and can compile down to various versions of JavaScript, ensuring broad compatibility across different environments.

- **Type Inference**: Even without explicit type annotations, TypeScript can often infer types based on how variables and functions are used, providing type safety with minimal extra code.

TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript, which can run in any environment that supports JavaScript, including browsers, Node.js, and other runtime environments.
